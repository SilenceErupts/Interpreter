Resulting Abstract Syntax Tree is written to console

Output Format:
Our ASTs extend very far to the right. To make our output console friendly:
- Every rightSibling is printed next to its predecessor, using an arrow (->) to indicate the link.
- Every leftChild starts on a new line, aligned to the leftmost position.

Using makefile:
Once you are inside the main directory, use command "make"
Produces executable "a.out"

Usage:
/a.out inputFileName

If not using makefile:
g++ -std=c++20 *.cpp *.h
